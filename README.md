HyperEdit
=========

A plugin for Kerbal Space Program, proudly maintained by Kerbaltek.

Pull requests are always welcome, as is any other input.  In fact, we rely on contributions to keep our projects going.  Please feel free to contact us here, in the KSP forums, and on our website.

To build:

Edit HyperEdit.csproj to fix KspInstallDir to point to the correct path (or build with /p:KspInstallDir=the_directory)

Then build HyperEdit.sln with xbuild/msbuild/VS/whatever.

VS2015 is required, or other C#6 compliant C# compiler (khyperia uses mono 4.2.2)
